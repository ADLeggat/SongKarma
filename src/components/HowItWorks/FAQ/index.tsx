                <h3>What can SongKarma do with my songs?</h3>
                <p>
                    By uploading your songs onto SongKarma, you give us permission to invite other songwriters to listen 
                    to your songs free of any fees, royalties or charges and rate them to gain a SongKarma chart 
                    position and critical peer feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The public will also be able to listen to your songs free of any charge, royalty or fee, and see 
                    publicity about them, but they will not be allowed to download them from SongKarma or score them.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    DJs who have been certified by SongKarma can download your songs to use for airplay. Downloads are 
                    not permitted for any other use, and SongKarma's certified DJs cannot use them for any other
                    purpose either.

                    SongKarma will not do anything else with your songs without seeking further written permission.

            </span>

            <span>
                <h3>Can my songs be downloaded by users?</h3>
                <p>
                    No: Only radio station DJs who have been certified by SongKarma can download your songs to use for 
                    airplay. Downloads are not permitted for any other use and SongKarma's certified DJ's cannot use 
                    them for any other purpose either.

                <h3>Offensive language or lyrics.</h3>
                <p>
                    Songwriters can submit songs containing whatever lyrics they wish, but radio stations will not play 
                    songs with offensive language, regardless of where the song may be in a SongKarma chart. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Songkarma will also remove songs which contain abusive messages which are likely to incite hatred or 
                    violence against the LBGTQ community, race or religion. Lyrics containing critical social and 
                    political commentary are valid and will be defended by SongKarma. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Decisions to remove content will be final and at the sole discretion of SongKarma, no correspondence 
                    will be entered into.

                <h3>My personal details</h3>
                <p>
                    The public will be able to see your submitted “MyKarma” profile only. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    SongKarma does not use your personal details for any other purpose than to contact you if necessary 
                    and help give your songs exposure via our certified radio stations and publicity contacts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do not give or sell your personal details to third parties.

                <h3>How many songs can I upload?</h3>
                <p>
                    You can only upload three songs at any one time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can delete those at any point and upload a different three songs, or leave them on SongKarma 
                    indefinitely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Four times per year SongKarma will hold a “Zero Hour” event, which will encourage songwriters to 
                    remove old material and add new. All chart scores will be set back to zero. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    These events will take place at 12am on 1st February, 1st May, 1st August and 1st December
                </p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <h3>How many songs can I score?</h3>
                <p>
                    You can score up to ten songwriter's material per week, so up to thirty songs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A week runs from 12.00am GMT Monday to 11.59.59 GMT Sunday.
                </p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <h3>Zero Hour and chart scores</h3>
                <p>
                    Four times per year SongKarma will hold a “Zero Hour” event, when all song chart scores will be set 
                    back to zero. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the ideal time to remove old material and add new, although new material can be added and 
                    old removed anytime. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    These events will take place at 12am on 1st February, 1st May, 1st August and 1st December

            <span>
                <h3>How many songs can I listen to?</h3>
                <p>
                    You can listen to as many songs as you wish.
                </p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <h3>How should I score songs?</h3>
                <p>
                    Honestly and sincerely. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    SongKarma exists as a tool to publicise a Songwriter's work and to help artists understand how their 
                    peers view that work critically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By being honest and sincere in your scoring, other artists can gauge trends in the feedback they 
                    receive and if desired use that to hone their own writing and song delivery skills.
                </p>
            </span>
            
            <span>
                <h3>What length can an uploaded song be?</h3>
                <p>
                    A song needs to be as long as a song needs to be, but for practical purposes, users cannot upload 
                    compositions which run for any more than 20mins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Radio stations will generally not play songs for longer than about 3mins, give or take 30 seconds or 
                    so, however, some of the radio stations we are supported by will play songs which run much longer 
                    than that without fading them out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SongKarma has no control over how long a radio station may choose to let your song run for if chosen 
                    for airplay, or how many times they may wish to air it.
                </p>
            </span>
            
            <span>
                <h3>Copyright infringement</h3>
                <p>
                    Songwriter's should only upload songs which they have written themselves or in which they are a 
                    credited writer collaborator, with permission to do so from their co-writers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a song should contain passages of copyrighted material of any kind, including samples, then 
                    songwriters should not upload that song without being in possession of legal permission to do so 
                    from the copyright owner or their representatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you believe a songwriter has uploaded material which they do not have legal permission for, 
                    please contact SongKarma and we will suspend the upload until such time as proof of copyright 
                    permissions can be provided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SongKarma will remove or suspend material it believes infringes copyright. Decisions to remove or 
                    suspend content will be final and at the discretion of Songkarma.
                </p>

            <span>
                <h3>Feedback visibility</h3>
                <p>
                    Other than your chart score, only you can see the feedback your peers leave you. Everybody can see 
                    your chart score.
                </p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <h3>My genre isn't listed</h3>
                <p>
                    Because there are hundreds of musical genres and sub-genres, SongKarma cannot provide a chart for 
                    every one of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So please choose a genre which you believe to be closest to the style your song sits within.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you believe there is a glaring omission of a major genre, by all means let us know.
                </p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <h3>How do I know if my song has been aired on a radio station?</h3>
                <p>
                    We generally have good communication with our radio station supporters and are made aware of what 
                    songs are being added to a playlist or will receive a one off airing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will pass this information on to you as we receive it, however, radio stations may well play your 
                    songs on a whim and we may never get to hear about it from them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you hear that your song has been played on a radio station and we haven't contacted you about it, 
                    we would be pleased to hear from you, as we like to thank our supporting radio stations for all the 
                    airplay they afford SongKarma participants. 
                </p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <h3>My songs are already being played on SongKarma's supporting radio stations</h3>
                <p>
                If your songs are already receiving airplay via one or more of our supporting radio stations, those 
                songs will not necessarily achieve more airtime because of your SongKarma chart position. 
                However, the fact that you have gained peer support for your songs, may well add value and encourage 
                more airplay and publicity. 
                </p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <h3>Does SongKarma receive money for songs aired on the radio?</h3>
                <p>
                    No. SongKarma does not receive any money for songs uploaded by it's participants and aired on a 
                    radio station.
                </p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <h3>Can I still send my songs directly to SongKarma's supporting radio stations?</h3>
                <p>
                    Where our supporting radio stations invite songwriters to submit material, we would very much 
                    encourage songwriters to do so, regardless of any help SongKarma chart exposure may afford.
                </p>
            </span>
            
            <span>
                <h3>How do I get articles about my songwriting published in “KarmaNews”?</h3>
                <p>
                    We wish to help songwriters gain exposure, and SongKarma will post interesting articles about 
                    participating songwriters and their songs, however, we can't post them all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To qualify, an article must be of genuine interest, well written, no more than 700 words and be 
                    supported by at least one quality photo 1MB in size or larger. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The service is free of charge to SongKarma songwriter participants.
                </p>
            </span>
 
            <span>
                <h3>What is a SongKarma participant?</h3>
                <p>
                    Songwriters who upload their songs and score another songwriter's material are considered 
                    participants. It's free to participate. 
                </p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <h3>How long do my songs remain on SongKarma?</h3>
                <p>
                    Your songs can potentially remain uploaded and live indefinitely, but SongKarma will periodically 
                    check your participating activity and if it appears you have not used SongKarma for a number of 
                    months, we will email you to ask you if you wish to keep the songs live, or if you wish us to remove 
                    them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we do not receive a reply, we reserve the right to remove them or leave them active.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we receive word from a third party that the songs should be removed because the songwriter has 
                    either died or no longer has the capacity to facilitate them on SongKarma, we will again send a 
                    message to the email address of the songwriter, and if we do not hear back from them within 14 days, 
                    we will remove the songs and the songwriter's profile.
                </p>

            <span>

                <p>
                    Anybody who writes at least three songs can participate, whether a professional songwriter, 
                    semi-professional or hobbyist. 
                </p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <h3>Which territories are permitted to participate?</h3>
                <p>
                    There are no restrictions for participation regarding territories, countries, states, areas etc.
                </p>
